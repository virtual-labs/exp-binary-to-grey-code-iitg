The purpose of this experiment is to design a 4-bit Binary to Gray code converter using exclusive-OR gates.

The input to the 4-bit binary-to-Gray code converter circuit is a 4-bit binary and the output is a 4-bit Gray code. There are 16 possible combinations of 4-bit binary input and all of them are valid. Hence no donâ€™t cares.
